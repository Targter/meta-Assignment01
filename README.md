# NFT Collection Management

This project is a simple JavaScript application that allows for the creation, storage, and management of NFT (Non-Fungible Token) metadata. The project includes functions to mint new NFTs, list all minted NFTs, and get the total supply of NFTs created.

## Description

The application provides a basic structure to manage NFT metadata, including details such as name, category, brand, specifications, price, and release year. It includes three main functions: `mintNFT` for creating new NFTs, `listNFTs` for displaying all stored NFT metadata, and `getTotalSupply` for returning the total number of NFTs minted.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the JavaScript file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nft-collection.git

2. Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).

### Executing program

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

2. Open a terminal in the project directory and run the JavaScript file using Node.js.
